# City Explorer

**Author**: Suhaib Ersan
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
An app that allows the user to check where a city is, and show it on a static map image.

## Getting Started
Needs to first `git clone` it, and then make sure to install the required ReactJS libraries, and then start the react server with `npm start` in the directory.

## Architecture
CSS and Design is still haven't been worked on. I'm using VS Code + WSL, then using JavaScript inside a ReactJS app to create this site, then Netlify to deploy it.
